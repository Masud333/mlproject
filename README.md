### MLProject
MLProject is a machine learning project that aims to predict the price of houses in Boston based on various features. It uses the Boston Housing Dataset from scikit-learn and applies linear regression and random forest models to train and test the data.

#### Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

#### Usage
To run this project, you need to clone this repository and run the main.py file:

git clone https://github.com/Masud333/mlproject.git
cd mlproject
python main.py

This will output the mean squared error and the coefficient of determination for both models, as well as a plot of the predicted vs actual prices.
